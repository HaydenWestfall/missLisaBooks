        <div class="employee-description">
          Lisa is a wife and mother of two who lives in Ludlow Falls, Ohio. She
          graduated from Slippery Rock University with a BA in both Special
          Education and Elementary Education and has spent the last 26 years
          working in the area of special education. Lisa is a lover of all
          things for children. When she’s not at work, she can be found
          kayaking, reading a book, or riding her bike. She also spends
          countless hours trying to convince friends and family to try something
          new with her, such as learning to play the ukulele, sleeping in a
          floating tent, eating at a new restaurant, or cardio drumming! Lisa
          enjoys organizing events and volunteering whenever possible at church
          and community events.

        <div class="employee-description">
          Parker and his high school sweetheart, Olivia, were born, raised, and
          continue to reside in Arcanum, Ohio. He has always had a love for the
          arts and a creative mind that never seems to shut off “new ideas.”
          Parker loves to draw and sketch the images that pop into his brain.
          Parker was born with colorblindness and has found that he enjoys the
          challenges that come along with bringing these images to full color.
          When he’s not illustrating or working his day job in the business
          world, he can likely be found renovating their 1800’s home, working on
          projects in his barn, making music with his friends, or planning his
          next big road trip across the country.
